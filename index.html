        <h1>Why Donate to Dogs?</h1>
        <p class="about-content">Dogs are man's best friend, and they deserve our love and support. They provide 
            us with unconditional love, companionship, and loyalty. They can also help us 
            to stay active and healthy. Unfortunately, many dogs are homeless or neglected. 
            They may be living in shelters, on the streets, or in abusive homes. By donating 
            to organizations that help dogs, you can make a difference in their lives.
        </p>
        <h1>How will my donation be used?</h1>

            It will be used to provide food, shelter, medical care, and love to 
            dogs who have been abandoned, neglected, or abused. It will also be 
            used to educate the public about responsible pet ownership.
